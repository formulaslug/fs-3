# Nuvoton NuMicro Cortex-M series

## Nuvoton fork of OpenOCD

Nuvoton NuMicro Cortex-M support for openocd is forked
[here](https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/OpenOCD-Nuvoton),
but has not yet upstreamed.
To enable openocd upload method for the series,
install [NuEclipse IDE](https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/Nuvoton_Tools)
which will also install the necessary openocd.

> **ℹ️ Information**

> On Windows, openocd will usually install at:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Nuvoton Tools\OpenOCD\bin\openocd.exe`.
