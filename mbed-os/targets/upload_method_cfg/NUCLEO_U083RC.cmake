# Mbed OS upload method configuration file for target NUCLEO_U083RC.
# To change any of these parameters from their default values, set them in your build script between where you
# include app.cmake and where you add mbed os as a subdirectory.

# Notes:
# 1. If your target is not natively supported by the pyOCD, then you need install a keil package for family of your target by hands. Type "pyocd pack show" to console and you will see a list of already installed packages.
# - If any package for your family is not on the list, then you need install them via command "pyocd pack install stm32h5" (take long time).Then just type "pyocd pack find STM32h5" or "pyocd pack find STM32h503" and you will see the part name of your target.
