# IMPORTANT: 

This is not an mbed-os project. This is for programming the ATTiny1616's on the Telemetry peripheral boards.

This requires the MPLab X VSCode extensions.

./mcc_generated_files/ was generated using MPLab Code Configurator. The config file for that session is not yet in this repository.
